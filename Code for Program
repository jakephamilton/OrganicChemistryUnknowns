Pseudo Code that needs to be translated is described below

The user will enter Y/N for "is the compound a solid?"
for yes, the user will be directed to enter a melting point
the program will pull all values from the SQL database within a +/- 20 range of the entered value
if null is entered, the program will proceed to boiling point

for no, the user will be directed to enter the boiling point 
the program will pull all values from the SQL database within a +/- 50 range of the entered value
if null is entered, the program will proceed to functional groups

the user will be directed to enter Y for all of the functional groups the user believes that they have

Does the compound contain an amine?
Does the compound contain an amide?
Does the compound contain an alkane?
Does the compound contain an alkene?
Does the compound contain an alcohol?
Does the compound contain a benzene?
Does the compound contain a sulfur?
Does the compound contain an aldehyde?
Does the compound contain a ketone?
Does the compound contain an ether?
Does the compound contain an ester?
... so on and so forth
the program will then pull all values fromt the SQL database that contain the selected functional groups

a list will then be displayed containing the names of all the compounds that met the criteria of all 4 data entry points
